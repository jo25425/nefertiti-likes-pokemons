Copyright:  April 4, 2006

A Menu System is a group of Menu and Choice Object arranged to provide a text
based interface for an end user.  These classes are aimed at making
development of Menu based systems easy and fast.

A Menu System is orgainzed into a heirarchy.  There is a top level Menu object,
which has a set of choices.  Any / All / None of this Menu's Choice objects can
contain sub-menus.  The Menu System heirarchy is extended downward by creating
Menu objects with Choice objects that have sub-menus.  As is natural, each 
Choice object can only have one sub-menu, but each Menu can have many Choice
objects.
"""

	"""Represents one level of a menu system
	
	A Menu System consists of one or more Menus.  Each Menu consists of a
	title, choices, and a prompt.  A Menu is required to have a title, a prompt
	and at least one choice.  There is no technical limit to the number of
	choices per menu, but asteticly and organizationally more than 10 will
	likely cause problems and should be divided into sub-menus.
	
	A Menu object is capable of displaying itself and of retreiving a choice
	from the user.  Both function only need to be called on the top
	level menu object.  The calls will trickle down to all of the menu object
	beneath it in the heirarchy as needed.
