Still to do:
MINOR >> 
- make it runnable on Windows? [is it even possible?]
- add a warning when illogical "reuse" option
- maybe display percentage together with size in Input-vs-files plots?

REAL WORK >> 
- models for individual parameters (vs files, run time)
- combine parameters/size in input
- information on run time
- add changes info
- models for distributions


To develop:
- the one for times could be improved too (days & weeks)
- information on memory usage
